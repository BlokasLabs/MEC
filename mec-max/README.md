#MEC for Max

an external which exposes expressive controllers to MAX

#status
does not compile yet :) 
I need to fix the link flags, to deal with the dynamic libs, for some reason its not working currently.


#todo
rationalise everything!
this is based on a max external I wrote for EigenFreeD for the Eigenharp, 
so I simply 'adjusted' it for MEC and moved it to the Max7 sdk.
so I will be updating it to reflect mec better... 
(also I'll be extending the mec-api to provide more integration possibiliies, and standardisation with AU/VST/standalone)
