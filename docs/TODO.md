- BUG: soundplane seems to quantise when it shouldnt try slide
- Pico (10.11) destroy() is resulting in usb shutdown continue, this is to do with pipe not killed, or perhaps its already been killed causes a loop at end
- use soundplanemodel, check it still works ;)
- eigenharp -> midi - velocity detection
- note mapping
